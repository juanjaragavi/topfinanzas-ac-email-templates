## Technical and Design Recommendations

Here are our recommendations for enhancing the user experience and technical implementation:

### 1. Design Reorganization (Mobile)

* **Call to Action (CTA) Button Placement**: Position the primary CTA button (e.g., "Accept Recommendation") above any ad blocks. This ensures immediate visibility for users, preventing confusion with advertisements and encouraging interaction.
* **Spacing and Clear Zones**: Increase the spacing between advertisements and other interactive elements on the interface. Implement appropriate margins or padding to create clear, distinct zones. This prevents the proximity of elements from misleading users and causing unintentional clicks, thereby improving overall usability and reducing accidental ad interactions.

### 2. Implement Visual Separators

* **Visual Clarity**: Introduce a horizontal line, a distinct background color shift, or a clear text block between ad units and CTA buttons. This visual separation is crucial to reduce the impression that the button is part of an ad, significantly improving clarity and helping users differentiate content from advertising elements.

### 3. Google Ad Manager (GAM) Tag Verification

* **Prevent Tag Duplication**: Confirm that the `mob_1` and `mob_2` tags are not being called more than once through fallback mechanisms within Google Ad Manager (GAM). This is critical for avoiding loading errors, preventing double-counting of impressions, and ensuring proper ad monetization. Review GAM reports and tag implementation to identify and resolve any redundant tag calls.
